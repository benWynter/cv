      <p><em>Full-Stack Web Developer & General Manager of <strong><a href="https://www.anytimefitness.co.uk/">Anytime Fitness</a></strong></em></p>
      <p>I’m the General Manager at Anytime Fitness in Tulse Hill and a talented linguist being bilingual in both English and French with a strong command of Spanish also. For the past four and and half years I’ve been responsible for club sales, membership retention, marketing strategy and operations.
    I spearheaded the club’s recovery from its closure due to the Covid-19 pandemic. During this period, membership numbers hit a record low but upon reopening, I was able to take control of the situation and lead the club out of despair and achieve greater turnover figures than pre-pandemic levels.
    Prior to working in the fitness industry, I worked in IT recruitment where I had the opportunity to learn about the world of IT which piqued my interest; to the point that I began learning the basics of C language in my free time in conjunction with the CS50x course from Harvard University.
    I am currently learning web development (HTML, CSS & JavaScript, the latter of which I have a particular interest in) as well as C# and Python with the goal of making a career change into web/software development.</p></td>
